# MAMI Theory

This repository hosts the core preprint of **The MAMI Theory (Meta-Architecture of Mind and Invisibility)** and three related theoretical modules:

- **The MAMI Theory (core framework)**
- **Epistemic Collapse Matrix (ECM)** – a diagnostic framework for structural invisibility
- **Invisible Retention Rate (IRR)** – a metric for measuring the preservation of non-legible information
- **Architectural Ethics** – an ethical framework at the level of epistemic design

Together, these works propose a meta-architectural approach to analyzing how epistemic, institutional, and technological systems depend on structured forms of invisibility.
